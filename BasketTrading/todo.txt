* roll a particular option
* on expiry, remove from active duty
  roll with no order
* for expired options, remove with no order
* will need account for assigned options

* perform optimized leg oriented automation
  * synthetic long:  roll up
  * synthetic short: exit at 0.10
  * covering short: exit at 0.10, on recovery to original, enter again?
  * protective long: roll down, roll across, on recovery to original, enter again, keep original

Therefore need to mark as to leg type, and apply appropriate algorithms

Exit the whole thing on appropriate over all profit

ie, extend one direction, then revert, then exit? or re-use some of the legs?

At expiry:
  * near options: roll forward
  * far options: close out everything?

* always have the 0.10 exit orders in place, in order to be first served
  cancel at session end

* at 0.10 on shorts, use that as location for new over-all entry?

* state machine for tracking option roll
