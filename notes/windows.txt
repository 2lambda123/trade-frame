git config --local core.autocrlf false

use the VS Vars command line to perform the following:

szip:
cd szip-2.1.1
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

then load the .sln file into visual studio 2019 16.1.6 or greater (some previous versions do not have cmake fixed)
add an x64 build mechanism
then all the projects need to have build and release converted to x64 tooling
also, for szip-static, szip-shared => properties - librarian - all options - additional options -> remove the x86 entry

then build with ALL_BUILD, the debug and release versions

files are in build\bin\Debug and build\bin\Release
