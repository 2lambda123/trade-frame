A market system can be further differentiated by other factors, one of
which is dependency. For example, say that in our moving average system
we discern (through methods discussed in this text) that winning trades
beget losing trades and vice versa. We would, therefore, break our moving
average system on any given market into two distinct market systems. One
of the market systems would take trades only after a loss (because of the
nature of this dependency, this is a more advantageous system), the other
market system only after a profit.

Pyramiding (adding on contracts throughout the course of a trade) is
viewed in a money management sense as separate, distinct market systems
rather than as the original entry. 

Each separate add-on should be treated as a
separate market system. There is a big benefit in doing this. The benefit is
that the techniques discussed in this book will yield the optimal quantities
to have on for a given market system as a function of the level of equity in
your account. 

we must marry modern portfolio theory
(which gives us optimal weights) with the notion of optimal quantity (optimal f) 
to arrive at a truly optimal portfolio.

In a nonleveraged situation, such as a portfolio of stocks that are not on
margin, weighting and quantity are synonymous, but in a leveraged situa-
tion, such as a portfolio of futures market systems, weighting and quantity
are different indeed. In this book you will see an idea first roughly intro-
duced in Portfolio Management Formulas, that optimal quantities are what
we seek to know, and that this is a function of optimal weightings.

 risk management is about decision-making
strategies that seek to maximize the ratio of potential reward to potential
risk within a given acceptable level of risk.

 Ultimately, we have no control over whether the
next trade will be profitable or not. Yet we do have control over the quantity
we have on. Since one does not dominate the other, our resources are better
spent concentrating on putting on the right quantity.

I follow about 75 gold/silver producers. Calculate a couple of ratios to find better values. In my opinion, the articles Hamilton of Zeal research wrote about the gold/silver ratios are FAR better than what the folks have written. He says to buy silver when the ratio gets above 55 and to sell when it drops to less than 45. Easy enough.

Get historical open interest.  Look at symbols with significant changes.  Use as indicator as how to trade.  
On equities, I believe it means borrowed securities for shorts.
On options, means how many have been written.
